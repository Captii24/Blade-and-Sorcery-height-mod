# Blade-and-Sorcery-height-mod
Increases the randomized heights of the NPCs so that they arent shorter than you in battle stance. 

To set this up, download the ZIP file, extract, and paste the contents into the Creatures folder in blade and sorcery, replacing the Creature_HumanMale and Female files.

if you want to further modify the heights to your liking, open the file, use CTRL F and type "randomMinHeight" or "randomMaxHeight" in the file to find the key, and you can change its value right next to it, then save.
